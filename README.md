First thoughts


find cheap yet powerful options for cpu
uses git
5 computers similiar?
doesnt need windows, is ok with linux
need a powerful graphics card
uses mechanical keyboards and a mouse with many buttons
needs the best network we can get.
needs a network storage.


Graphics card: should be at least a ASUS GeForce GTX 1060 3GB Phoenix Fan($531 on amazon) or as powerful,
on the priceier side a GTX 1070/1070 TI

preferably an intelcore i7 or higher
but a Ryzen 5 1400($200 from mikes computer shop) will run high settings.

Crucial 8GB 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 2400($104.99) for Ram.

Deepcool Gammaxx 400 for the HSF($25)

ASrock AB350 Pro4($109.05) or a ASUS Prime Z370-A LGA 1151/ASRock Z370 Killer SLI/ac LGA 1151
for a bit pricier but better preformance.

Seagate BarraCuda ST1000DM010 1TB($54 from newegg)  should work for memory.

NZXT - Source 530 ATX Full Tower Case($99 from Newegg) will suit your needs for a case.

SeaSonic - EVO Edition 620W 80+ Bronze Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply($85 from Newegg) for a power supply 

 logitech g600($60 from amazon) for mouse
 
 Asus Xonar GHX PCIe GX2.5($50 from Vuugo or PC-Canada) for soundcard.
 
 Philips - 223V5LSB 21.5" 1920x1080 60Hz Monitor($99 from PC-Canada)
 
 Redragon K552 LED Mechanical Keyboard($40 from amazon)
 
 Linux (free)
 
 The best server would be client server with bus topology.
 
Total price per computer = $1457<br>
Total price = $7285
