# Client-2
Client project


First thoughts


find cheap yet powerful options for cpu
uses git
5 computers similiar?
doesnt need windows, is ok with linux
need a powerful graphics card
uses mechanical keyboards and a mouse with many buttons
needs the best network we can get.
needs a network storage.


Graphics card: should be at least a Nvidia GTX 1060 or as powerful
on the priceier side a GTX 1080 Ti
preferably an intelcore i7 or higher
