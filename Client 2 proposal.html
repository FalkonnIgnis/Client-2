        <h3 id="abstract">The Abstract</h3>
        <p>Throughout this webpage we will talk about the build options, the network I believe you should use and the topology<br>
            along with a folder structure I enjoy using and think would be useful and the OS</p>

<p><h2 id="network">Network and Topology:</h2>The best server would be client server with bus topology so that you all have access<br>
     to the same work and server. You also want the client server so that you have more security and so that no one has to put<br>
     strain on the computer to try and host something to run the game. </p>

<h2"software">Software and structuring</h2>
    <p>The file system i would use is just to use many sub folders to stay<br>
very organized. have one seperate folder for each thing inside three main ones named <ul><li>Work Current</li><li>Work Upcoming</li>
    <li>Archives</li></ul> you will also need a web browser of somekind and to setup Linux. You might also want to check out ATOM<br>
so you can work offline if you ever have to, plus it helps organize the code and make it easier on your eyes.</p>
<h2 id="reason">Reasoning</h2>
<p>My reasoning behind the products I suggested are because those are the minimum required to have a good experience at the highest 
    level of games with new games<br> I suggested client server so that you have security for your games and you don't need to have<br>
    someone deal with the strain of running a server to test your games. I believe the bus topology is the best because you all have<br>
    access to the same files that way especially utilising the client server as a hub. The Web browser is for Github and I also 
    suggested Atom<br> so you can work offline.</p>

<h2 id="reflect">Reflection</h2>
<p>The hardest part for me was to figure out the topology and the network setup to use.<br>
    I learned even more details about using html and about computer hardware.<br>
    I would not have wanted to complete this project for the other client because the information I obtain here can also be used for
    <br>my hobbies and to learn more about the advancements in the game development field.</p>
